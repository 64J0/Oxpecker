# Oxpecker

Oxpecker is a functional wrapper around ASP.NET Core Endpoint routing (sometimes called Minimal API).

This library is basically an improved version of Giraffe endpoint routing, still mostly sticking to it successful API (hence the name). Improvement involves changing some core types, performance of template handlers, simplifying handlers and dropping a lot of outdated functionality.
